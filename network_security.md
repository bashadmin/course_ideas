### 1. Introduction to Security Posture
- **Overview**: Fundamentals of security posture across different layers of an environment, including application, server, and API security.
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of a holistic security approach and familiarize with the basic concepts of security layers.

### 2. Building and Hardening Secure Environments
- **Topics**: Golden images, standard builds, CIS (Center for Internet Security) Critical Security Controls, and minimizing the attack surface through hardened configurations.
- **Objective**: Teach students how to create secure, standardized environments using code, focusing on AWS EC2 instances and the importance of minimizing enabled features to reduce vulnerabilities.

### 3. Authentication and Access Control
- **Topics**: Role-based access control (RBAC), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), active directory and Kerberos integration, one-time passwords, and entitlements.
- **Objective**: Equip students with the knowledge to implement robust authentication systems and manage access controls effectively, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions.

### 4. Network and Infrastructure Security
- **Topics**: VPC setup, ACLs, firewall configurations, secure direct connect and MPLS connections, and on-premises hardware considerations.
- **Objective**: Provide practical skills in securing network infrastructure, focusing on AWS and hybrid environments, including the selection of appropriate firewall solutions.

### 5. Application and API Security
- **Topics**: Rate limiting, API keys management, SSL certificates, certificate authorities (e.g., Let's Encrypt), CSR (Certificate Signing Request) processing, and secure application deployment.
- **Objective**: Deep dive into application-level security, teaching students how to secure APIs, manage SSL certificates, and ensure applications are deployed securely.

### 6. Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Topics**: Introduction to tools like Splunk, Elastic Stack, and RSA for managing and analyzing security events and logs.
- **Objective**: Familiarize students with SIEM tools, focusing on log analysis, vulnerability detection, and response strategies.

### 7. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Dependency Management
- **Topics**: Peer reviews, identifying vulnerable dependencies, and staying updated with security patches.
- **Objective**: Teach best practices for developing secure applications, including the use of OWASP Top 10 guidelines and web application firewalls.

### 8. Certificate Lifecycle Management
- **Topics**: Managing SSL/TLS certificates, preventing certificate expiration, and understanding root and issuing certificate authorities.
- **Objective**: Ensure students understand the importance of certificate management and how to prevent service disruptions due to expired certificates.

### 9. Capstone Project
- **Description**: A team-based project where students apply their knowledge to design a secure infrastructure, implement security controls, and respond to simulated security incidents.
- **Objective**: Demonstrate comprehensive understanding and practical skills in securing digital environments, readying students for roles in cybersecurity and infrastructure management.

### Implementation Considerations:
- **Duration**: A detailed schedule should be developed, balancing theory with hands-on labs.
- **Industry Partnerships**: Engage with companies to align the curriculum with industry needs and facilitate student placements.
- **Mentorship**: Incorporate mentorship from industry professionals to provide real-world insights and guidance.
